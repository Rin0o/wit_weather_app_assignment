# wit_weather_app_assignment

This app is my answer to Wit recruitment challenge 
The app uses the http://openweathermap.org/api weather API to get its data
The icons used belong to Freepik from FlatIcon.

Notes:
-I opted by using a more minimalistic aspect with only one screen to show the data
-The app used 2 endpoints to get the data, the first to get the current location weather details 
and a second one to get the cities details as per requested in the challange
-I did not have time to implement data persistance, but if I did, I would have done it in the WeatherRepository class
-With persistance implemented there would not be the need to constantly request the API and the user could see some info 
even in case of lack of internet
-The libraries used can be seen in the build.gradle file
Any question can be answered via email.
